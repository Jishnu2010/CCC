 <h4>Contact information</h4> 
   <p style="color:blue;font-size: 10px;">
    Because of privacy reasons, I prefer to not reveal my name. So if you wish to contact me, you'll have to follow the directions written in the <a href="info.html"> More Info </a> page to make a lichess account and message me there. To message me on lichess, there are 2 ways possible. One way is to go to magnifying glass in the upper right corner. Click on that and search "Komokid". That is my username on lichess. Once there, Click on the message icon that looks like a speech bubble. Or, you could do the other way by simply clicking the link to my inbox. 
    <a href="https://lichess.org/inbox/komokid">My inbox</a>
     From there you should be able to message me. Feel free to ask any questions or concerns. Also, I'm a new web developer so I would love it if you could give me suggestions.
