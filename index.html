   <p class="p">Obviously, many of you know about homeless people. I believe that everyone in the world should have equal chances at life. If I have a roof above my head, and a house to keep me safe. I think other people deserve that too. That is why I decided to make this website. I made this website to help raise money for charities helping homeless people. Basically, I will be making prize tournaments on the website lichess.org. Then, I plan to give half of the money I earn from the tournament to charities that are helping homeless people. Especially during these times, I think it is important to make sure that everyone has a place they can comfortably live in. So please help me help those in need of help. Lets make the world a better place tiny steps at a time. </p>
