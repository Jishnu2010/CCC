     Anyways, feel free to explore the website if you are new. Of course lichess is a great website, but there are many other websites I think you would like to use. Here's a list: 
    <a href="https://www.chess.com/">chess.com</a>
     , 
    <a href="https://chess24.com/en">chess24.com</a>
     , 
    <a href="https://www.chessclub.com/">ICC</a>
     , Feel free to explore the other websites too! But all tournaments are commenced on lichess. Also, just a warning, to have all the good features of chess.com, you have to pay for a membership. Its why I like lichess. But if you pay for the membership, chess.com has some awesome features. Have fun with chess! And don't take every loss too hard.
